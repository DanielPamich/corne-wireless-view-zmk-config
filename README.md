Flashing, Firmware, and Bootloaders#

One of the great things about the nice!nano is how easy it is to flash the device. To jump into the bootloader all you need to do is double tap reset. You can do this by either double tapping your reset button on your keyboard, or you can double tap RST and GND pins on the nice!nano quickly with tweezers.

Once you are into the bootloader, connect your nice!nano via USB to your computer if you haven't already. Your nice!nano should now show up in your OS as a USB storage device named "NICENANO".

Flashing is now as easy as copying a .uf2 firmware file to the storage device. You can do this by copying in the terminal, dragging and dropping it in your file explorer, or however else you copy files to a storage device in your OS.
